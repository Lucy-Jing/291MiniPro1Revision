# CMPUT 291 Mini Project 1 -Fall 2024
Group member names and ccids (3-4 members)
* Darlene Nguyen, maianh1@ualberta.ca
* Khanh Bui, kdbui@ualberta.ca
* Norman Wong, norman4@ualberta.ca
* Lucy Jing, luping2@ualberta.ca

# Group work break-down strategy
We agreed with the work divided among everyone, and communicated effectively on Discord.
- We arranged 4 meetings in total (each last at least 4 hours):
Introduction and Dividing
Checking on the progress of each functionality
Combining and Test the main function
Revising the code to meet all the requirements of the mini project 1
Each person spent at least 10 - 15 hours to complete their part
Communication was effective and straight-forward via Discord group message, and in-person meetings.
-   	When any member detected the bugs, that member would fix it on their own files first before pushing it into Github.
-   	We always notify each other whenever there are any changes in codes due to bugs, displaying, etc.
Work division:
*   Darlene Nguyen: Compose Tweet, Login Page (i.e. structure, email checking), Displaying, testing, dividing work
*   Norman Wong: Search for Users, Login Page (i.e structure), Testing
*   Khanh Bui: Search for Tweets, Login Page (i.e structure), main.py structure, Debugging
*   Lucy Jing: List Followers, Database Sample, Testing


# Code execution guide
We run the program with the command line "python3 main.py test.db" (this is a placeholder name) on the lab machine. Once the program runs, we prompt the program to ask if the user has had an account in the system. If the user is new to the system, we prompt the user to enter all of their info, in order to create an account. After logging in, the user can get access to all functionalities that we have in our system by entering what they decide to do (‘search tweet’, ‘search user’, ‘tweet’, ‘reply’, ‘retweet’, ‘list followers’, ‘log out’, ‘exit’). Once an action word is entered, the functionality corresponding to that input will run. After the result is displayed/ the tweet is successfully posted, the system is prompted to ask the user what they want to do once again. The program will eventually stop after it receives the input of ‘exit’ or CTRL+C on the lab machine.

Log In Page - Prompts the user to choose between login or registration. When logging in, the user will need to remember their User ID and their passcode. If the passcode is incorrect, they will need to reattempt. If the user needs a new account, function will ask for a name, email, phone number, and password. The system assigns a unique User ID to each new user.

After the welcome message, the system will ask what the user would like to do. They can either: ‘search tweet’, ‘search user’, ‘tweet’, ‘reply’, ‘retweet’, ‘list followers’, ‘log out’, ‘exit’.

Search user requires a keyword, and will display up to 5 users that contain that keyword anywhere in their username. If the current user would like to see more users, they have the option to see more. If they would like to know more about a specific user, they will need to input the desired User ID. From there, the current user will also have the option to see more of the desired user's tweets or follow them.

Search tweet requires a keyword or a hashtag, and will display up to 5 tweets (and the matching Tweet ID) that contain that keyword or hashtag. If the user would like to see more similar tweets, they have the option to see more.
In order to tweet, the user will simply type out the tweet they would like to post.
In order to retweet, the user will need to enter the Tweet ID, then confirm that they would like to share that tweet.
In order to reply to a tweet, the user will need to enter the Tweet ID, and then type out the reply they would like to post.

List followers displays all the followers of the current user, and if there are more than 5, they have the option to see more. If the current user would like to see more about a desired user, they will need to enter the username of the follower. From there, they can follow that user back or see more of their tweets. 

Log out lets the user log out of the program but will not close the program.
Exit will bring the user back to the previous screen unless on the main page, which will then close the program.

# Names of anyone you have collaborated with (as much as it is allowed within the course policy) or a line saying that you did not collaborate with anyone else.  
We did not collaborate with anyone else.

Sample testing: 
Sample Data--Generated by AI The design of the sample data we used for testing takes some edge cases into consideration, such as duplicate user names, multiple hashtags under one post, and spam retweets.
